fuzzy_kalman_mppt
=================

The project tries to implement a novel approach to track maximum power point of a solar PV module. The idea is to use fuzzy logic and develop Kalman filter algorithm according to it to enhance the stability of the outcoming power from a solar PV module. The project uses VHDL and the code is tested on Altera Cyclone 2 family device EP2C20F484C7. Presently, code has been written using behavorial and structural modelling and a layout of the design is made. The code is working perfectly for single round, however for a continuous approach, a lot of timing related problems are being faced. Testbench code is written for individual layers of the design to experiment with and find solutions. Feel free to notify changes anywhere. Any kind of help with the scheduling is highly appreciated. Thank you.
